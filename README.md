This repository contains most of the projects I made during almost four years of college (Faculty of Automation Control and Computer Science, Specialization Computer Science and Information Technology, Polytechnic University of Bucharest).
These materials are entirely made by me.
You cannot use any of these materials without my permission. If you need any of them you can contact me at andreyemanuel13@yahoo.com.
I'm open to new projects using any programming language, especially C/C++, Java and Python.
This repository will be updated periodically.

Have a nice day! ^^
