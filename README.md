This repository contains some of the projects I made during almost 4 years of college (2015-2019) @ Faculty of Automation Control and Computer Science, Specialization Computer Science and Information Technology, Polytechnic University of Bucharest.
These materials are entirely made by myself.  
Please feel free to contact me if you need any information or would like to use my code.
I'm open to new projects using any programming language, especially C/C++, Java and Python.

Have a nice day! ^^
